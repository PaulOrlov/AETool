# AETool
Abstract Experiment Tool (AETool) is the software for behavior studies and eye-tracking experiments. It still in a development process, but it's ready for real studies. AETool could be used for gaze-contingent experiments also in a communication with SMI iViewX system. With AETool you can create Project for your study, add subjects, stimulus, run experiments and collect data.

AETool bases on NetBeans Platform. You can create Project in AETool for each study. There are three main modules for Project, they are: Participant, Stimuli and Experiment. You can easily add subjects, edit them or delete.

To conduct an experiment, you have to create it, select subject for current experiment and run it.
 
The most interesting module is Stimuli, because for each study it seems to create individual logic of stimuli or presentation logic. For example, you can use JPG figures with radio bottoms as stimuli. From other hand, you probably have to conduct study with text-based stimuli. In this case, it is necessary to modify Stimuli module by hand. As you see, AETool follows NetBeans Platform's module paradigm. And if you like to create your one kind of stimuli, you can create new module for it in NetBeans.
